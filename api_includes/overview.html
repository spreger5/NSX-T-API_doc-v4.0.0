<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  NSX provides a programmatic API to automate
  management activities.  The API follows a resource-oriented
  Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture, using JSON
  object encoding. Clients interact with the API using RESTful web service
  calls over the HTTPS protocol.
</p>
<p>
  Each API method is identified by a request method and URI.  Method
  parameters are specified as key-value pairs appended to the URI.  Unless
  otherwise noted, request and response bodies are encoded using JSON, and
  must conform to the JSON schema associated with each method.  The content
  type of each request and reply is "application/json" unless otherwise
  specified.  Each request that can be made is documented in the API Methods
  section.  The associated request and response body schemas are documented in
  the API Schemas section.
</p>
<p>
  If you provide URL-encoded UTF-8 characters in the URL of your API request,
  you must include the header "Content-Type:charset=UTF-8" in your request.
</p>

<h3>API Policy: Changes, Deprecations and Removals</h3>
<p>
VMware NSX and associated firewall offerings may add
new features in a NSX release. These new features
may lead to additional APIs or backward compatible changes to
existing APIs to support the new features.
</p>
<p>
Changes to the API that lead to incompatibility with previous
releases will be announced at least one year prior to the
change. APIs or API attributes that will be removed will
be marked "deprecated" in the API Guide. These changes
can be implemented in either major or minor releases of NSX.
</p>
<p>
NSX APIs marked as "experimental" or that are not
documented in the NSX API Guide are not subject
to this policy. This indicates that the API may be changed or
removed without notice in a future NSX release.
</p>
<p>
Definitions:
<ul>
<li>Major Release: Designated by an increment of the "x" digit of the x.y.z product version.</li>
<li>Minor Release: Designated by an increment of the "y" digit of the x.y.z product version.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>API Data Types and Allowed Ranges</h3>
<p>
The NSX API uses JSON to represent API request and response payloads,
and uses JSONSchema to describe the schema of these payloads.
The data types are:
<p>
string: a sequence of UTF-8 characters. If a particular string property
has a maximum length, it is represented in the documentation with a
maxLength property.
</p>
<p>
integer: a signed 64-bit value. Unless a minimum or maximum value is
shown in the documentation, integer values may take on values in the
range -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
</p>
<p>
unsigned_integer: an unsigned 64-bit value. Unless a minimum or maximum value is
shown in the documentation, integer values may take on values in the
range 0 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
</p>
<p>
int: a signed 32-bit value. Unless a minimum or maximum value is
shown in the documentation, int values may take on values in the
range -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
</p>
<p>
number: a 64-bit floating point number. Unless a minimum or maximum value is
shown in the documentation, number values may take on values in the
range 4.9406564584124654 x 10<sup>-324</sup> to
1.7976931348623157 x 10<sup>308</sup>.
</p>
<p>
boolean: the values true or false. Do not use quotes when sending boolean
values in payloads.
</p>
<p>
object: a nested JSON object.
</p>
<p>
array: an array of one of the above types.
</p>


<h3>Formats</h3>
<p>
Some API types have a required format, and payloads that do not conform to
the required format will be rejected. If a property has a required format,
it is listed in the "Notes" section in this API Guide. The following
formats are used in NSX:
</p>

<p>
ipv4: Must be a valid Internet Protocol version 4 address, in dotted-quad
notation. For example, "192.168.1.232".
</p>

<p>
ipv6: Must be a valid Internet Protocol version 6 address, as described
in RFC 1924. For example, "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334".
Abbreviations are supported.
</p>

<p>
ip: Either an ipv4 or ipv6 address.
</p>

<p>
hostname: An internet hostname, as described in RFC 1123. For example,
"example.com"
</p>

<p>
ipv4-cidr-block: An ipv4 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block,
expressed as a base ipv4 address, a slash, and the number of bits in the
subnet mask. For example, "10.1.0.1/24".
</p>

<p>
ipv6-cidr-block: An ipv6 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block,
expressed as a base ipv6 address, a slash, and the number of bits in
the subnet mask. For example, "2001:db8::/32".
</p>

<p>
ip-cidr-block: Either an ipv4-cidr-block or an ip-v6-cidr-block.
</p>

<p>
ipv4-address-range: A range of ipv4 addresses, expressed as a lower-bound
ipv4 address, a dash, and an upper-bound ipv4 address. For example,
"192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255"
</p>

<p>
ipv6-address-range: A range of ipv6 addresses, expressed as a lower-bound
ipv6 address, a dash, and an upper-bound ipv6 address. For example,
"fe80::0202:b3ff:fe1e:8329-fe80::0202:b3ff:fe1e:832a"
</p>

<p>
address-or-block-or-range: Either an ip address, an ip-cidr-block, an
ipv4-address-range, or an ipv6-address-range.
</p>

<p>
port-or-range: A port number (an integer in the range 0 to 65535) or a
range of port numbers, expressed as a lower and upper port number,
separated by a dash. Examples: "80" or "997-1023".
</p>

<p>
hostname-or-ip: Either a hostname or an ip address.
</p>

<p>
hostname-or-ipv4: Either a hostname or an ipv4 address.
</p>

<p>
list-of-address-or-block-or-range: A comma-separated list
address-or-block-or-range.
</p>

<p>
mac-address: A Media Access Control (MAC) address. MAC addresses are six
hexadecimal numbers, separated by either colons ":" or dashes "-". Case
is not significant. Examples: "20:f3:75:5e:47:f0" or "20-F3-75-5E-47-F0".
</p>

<h3>Request Failures</h3>
<p>
  It is possible for any request to fail.  Errors are reported using standard
  HTTP response codes.  It should be assumed the following errors could be
  returned by any API method: 301 Moved Permanently, 307 Temporary Redirect, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 412 Precondition Failed, 429 Too Many Requests, 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable.  Where other errors may be
  returned, the type of error is indicated in the API method description.  All
  errors are documented in the API Errors section.

  API requests may fail due to concurrent updates, where an API request
  collides with another API request, and NSX cannot reconcile the
  two operations. In that case, the client must re-fetch the resource,
  apply the changes, and re-submit the operation.
</p>
<h3>Request Authentication</h3>
<p>
Most API calls require authentication.  This API supports
several different authentication schemes, which are documented
in this section. Multiple authentication schemes may not be
used concurrently.
</p>

<h4>HTTP Basic Authentication</h4>
<p>
To authenticate a request using HTTP Basic authentication, the caller's
credentials are passed using the 'Authorization' header.  The header
content should consist of a base64-encoded string containing the username and
password separated by a single colon (":") character, as specified in
RFC 1945 section 11.1.
</p>
<p>
For example, to authenticate a request using the credentials of
user <span class="code">admin</span> with password
<span class="code">admin</span>, include the following header with the
request:
</p>
<div class="code_block">
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
</div>
<p>
The following cURL command will authenticate to the manager using basic
authentication and will issue a GET request for logical ports:
</p>
<div class="code_block">
curl -k -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://MANAGER/api/v1/logical-ports
</div>
<p>
where:<br>
<span class="code">USERNAME</span> is the user to authenticate as,<br>
<span class="code">PASSWORD</span> is the password to provide, and<br>
<span class="code">MANAGER</span> is the IP address or host name of the NSX manager<br>
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<div class="code_block">
curl -k -u admin:secretPw99 https://192.168.22.32/api/v1/logical-ports
</div>
<p>
Note: the <span class="code">-k</span> argument instructs cURL to skip
verifying the manager's self-signed X.509 certificate. It is more secure
to verify that the server's certificate is signed by a Certificate Authority
(CA) that you trust. To do that, omit the -k argument and use the
--cacert &lt;ca-file&gt; option, where &lt;ca-file&gt; is a PEM-formatted
file containing the CA certificate to trust.
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<div class="code_block">
curl --cacert /home/me/certs/rootca.crt  -u admin:secretPw99 https://192.168.22.32/api/v1/logical-ports
</div>
<p>
Additional cURL examples below use the -k flag, but you can always substitute
the --rootca &lt;ca-file&gt; argument for additional security.
</p>
<p>
In the above examples, USERNAME may be:
<ol>
  <li>A local user name. For example, "admin".</li>
  <li>A remote user name, of the form "user@domain", for example,
      "joe@example.com". The domain must match a domain for a configured
      VIDM identity source or a configured LDAP identity source.</li>
</ol>

Note: in earlier versions of NSX, in order to authenticate to VIDM, it
was required that you provide an authentication header of the form
"Authorization: Remote base64-encoded-username-and-password". This is
no longer required, but still functions for backward compatibility.

<h4>Session-Based Authentication</h4>
<p>
Session-based authentication is used by calling the
<span class="code">/api/session/create</span> authentication API to manage
a session cookie.  The session cookie returned in the result of a successful
login must be provided in subsequent requests in order to associate those
requests with the session.
</p>
<p>
Session state is local to the server responding to the API request.
Idle sessions will automatically time-out, or can be terminated
immediately using the <span class="code">POST /api/session/destroy</span> API.
</p>

<p>
To obtain a session cookie, POST form data to the server using the
application/x-ww-form-urlencoded media type, with fields "j_username" and
"j_password" containing the username and password separated by an ampersand.
Since an ampersand is a UNIX shell metacharacter, you may need to
surround the argument with single quotes.
</p>
<p>
If the user is a remote user, append "@domain" to the username, for
example, "joe@example.com". The domain must match a domain for a
configured VIDM identity source or a configured LDAP identity source.
</p>
<p>
The following cURL command
will authenticate to the server, will deposit the session cookie
in the file "cookies.txt", and will write all HTTP response headers
to the file headers.txt. One of these headers is the X-XSRF-TOKEN
header that you will need to provide in subsequent requests.
</p>


<div class="code_block">
curl -k -c cookies.txt -D headers.txt -X POST     -d 'j_username=USERNAME&j_password=PASSWORD'     https://MANAGER/api/session/create
</div>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<div class="code_block">
curl -k -c cookies.txt -D headers.txt -X POST     -d 'j_username=admin&j_password=secretPw99'     https://192.168.22.32/api/session/create
</div>

<p>
The manager will respond with the roles and permissions granted to the user,
and cURL will deposit the session cookie into the file "cookies.txt".
</p>

<p>
In subsequent cURL requests, use the -b argument to specify the cookie file.
You also need to pass the X-XSRF-TOKEN header that was saved to the
headers.txt file, using cURL's -H option:
</p>

<div class="code_block">
curl -k -b cookies.txt -H "`grep -i X-XSRF-TOKEN headers.txt`"     https://192.168.22.32/api/v1/logical-ports
</div>

<p>
When the session expires, the manager will respond with a 403 Forbidden
HTTP response, at which point you must obtain a new session cookie
and X-XSRF-TOKEN.
</p>

<p>
Session cookies can be destroyed by using the /api/session/destroy
API:
</p>

<div class="code_block">
curl -k -b cookies.txt -H "`grep -i X-XSRF-TOKEN headers.txt`"     -X POST https://MANAGER/api/session/destroy
</div>

<h4>Authentication using an X.509 certificate and a Principal
Identity</h4>

<p>
NSX supports using an X.509 client certificate for authentication.
The certificate is associated with a principal identity (a short
name, similar to a username), and that principal identity
can be bound to an NSX role. This is useful for automated
processes or scripts that perform NSX API calls, and has
the advantage that a user password does not need to be stored
with the script.
</p>
<p>
For information on how to import a certificate and set up a
principal identity, see the section "Add a Role Assignment or
Principal Identity" in the NSX Administration Guide.
</p>
<p>
To use the client certificate to authenticate, your client
must have access to the certificate and its associated private
key. How to specify client authentication depends on the client
you are using. For example, with curl, you use the --key argument
to give the filename containing the private key and the
--cert argument to give the filename containg the public
certificate.
</p>

<h4>Authentication in VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC)</h4>
<p>
To make API calls to an NSX Manager in the VMware Cloud on AWS
service (VMC), you need to gather a few pieces of information:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your VMC Organization ID</li>
  <li>Your Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) ID</li>
  <li>Your API token</li>
</ol>

<p>
All of this information is available in the VMC web console, <a href="https://console.cloud.vmware.com">https://console.cloud.vmware.com</a>
</p>

<p>
In VMC, you always exchange your API token for a
limited-duration authentication token, which you then pass in a
header with your API calls. This authentication token is valid
for 30 minutes. After that time, you must obtain a new
authentication token using your API token. If you use an
expired authentication token, the API call will be rejected.
</p>

<p>
To obtain an authentication token, you issue a POST request to
the URL
https://console.cloud.vmware.com/csp/gateway/am/api/auth/api-tokens/authorize,
passing your API token in a form. To do this with cURL:
</p>

<div class="code_block">
curl https://console.cloud.vmware.com/csp/gateway/am/api/auth/api-tokens/authorize -d refresh_token=&lt;token&gt;
</div>

<p>
For example, if your refresh token is
aB1jtC5yk2rDL6A1KPxzM0W4D7OeHFUNuXFHZidufYS3fIwn60ZRag0Y9dvX15Qv, the command will be:
</p>

<div class="code_block">
curl https://console.cloud.vmware.com/csp/gateway/am/api/auth/api-tokens/authorize -d refresh_token=aB1jtC5yk2rDL6A1KPxzM0W4D7OeHFUNuXFHZidufYS3fIwn60ZRag0Y9dvX15Qv
</div>

<p>
You will receive a JSON response with several properties. The
"access_token" property contains the token you will need to
provide with your API requests. An easy way to parse this token
out of the response is to use the "jq" utility. For example:
</p>

<div class="code_block">
curl https://console.cloud.vmware.com/csp/gateway/am/api/auth/api-tokens/authorize -d refresh_token=aB1jtC5yk2rDL6A1KPxzM0W4D7OeHFUNuXFHZidufYS3fIwn60ZRag0Y9dvX15Qv | jq --raw-output '.access_token'
</div>

<p>
produces just the access token. You can set an environment variable with the correct authentication header with:
</p>

<div class="code_block">
export AUTH_HDR="csp-auth-token: `curl https://console.cloud.vmware.com/csp/gateway/am/api/auth/api-tokens/authorize -d refresh_token=aB1jtC5yk2rDL6A1KPxzM0W4D7OeHFUNuXFHZidufYS3fIwn60ZRag0Y9dvX15Qv | jq --raw-output '.access_token'`"
</div>

<p>
The AUTH_HDR environment variable now contains the authentication
header. The token itself will be a long string of characters and
digits.
</p>

<p>
Once you have your authentication token, you need to determine
the URL for accessing the NSX manager in your SDDC. To do that,
you issue a GET request to the endpoint
https://vmc.vmware.com/vmc/api/orgs/&lt;org-id&gt;/sddcs/&lt;sddc-id&gt;,
where &lt;org-id&gt; is your organization's ID and &lt;sddc-id&gt; is your
SDDC's ID. The URL of the NSX manager will be in the
resource_config.nsx_api_public_endpoint_url property. For
example, if your organizations's ID is
a003c3a5-3f68-4a8c-a74f-f79a0625da17 and your SDDC is
449369c7-7936-4f7f-b46e-624cdb2a0a99:
</p>

<div class="code_block">
curl -H "$AUTH_HDR" https://vmc.vmware.com/vmc/api/orgs/a003c3a5-3f68-4a8c-a74f-f79a0625da17/sddcs/449369c7-7936-4f7f-b46e-624cdb2a0a99 | jq --raw-output ".resource_config.nsx_api_public_endpoint_url"
</div>

<p>
The output will look like:
</p>

<div class="code_block">
https://nsx-52-41-15-143.rp.vmwarevmc.com/vmc/reverse-proxy/api/orgs/a003c3a5-3f68-4a8c-a74f-f79a0625da17/sddcs/449369c7-7936-4f7f-b46e-624cdb2a0a99/sks-nsxt-manager
</div>

<p>
This is the URL you should use to access your NSX manager from
the internet. Append the particular API's URL to this base URL.
For example, to list all domains, the API is
"/policy/api/v1/infra/domains", so the full request will look
like the following:
</p>

<div class="code_block">
curl -q -H "$AUTH_HDR" https://nsx-52-41-15-143.rp.vmwarevmc.com/vmc/reverse-proxy/api/orgs/a003c3a5-3f68-4a8c-a74f-f79a0625da17/sddcs/449369c7-7936-4f7f-b46e-624cdb2a0a99/sks-nsxt-manager/policy/api/v1/infra/domains
</div>

<h3>Example Requests and Responses</h3>
<p>Example requests and responses are provided for most of the API calls below.
Your actual response might differ from the example in the number of fields
returned because optional empty fields are not returned when you make an API
call.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on Certain Fields in a Request</h3>
<p>When configuring layer 2 switching, the following fields can contain any
character except semicolon (;), vertical bar (|), equal sign (=), comma (,),
tilde (~), and the "at" sign (@). They also have a length limitation as
specified below:
<ul>
  <li>Logical switch display name. Maximum length: 80 bytes.</li>
  <li>Host switch name in TransportZone. Maximum length: 80 bytes.</li>
  <li>Uplink name in UplinkHostSwitchProfile. Maximum length: 47 bytes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Optimistic Concurrency Control and the _revision property</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>In order to prevent one client from overwriting another client's
updates, NSX employs a technique called optimistic concurrency
control.
<p>All REST payloads contain a property named &quot;_revision&quot;.
This is an integer that is incremented each time an existing resource
is updated. Clients must provide this property in PUT requests
and it must match the current _revision or the update will be
rejected. This guards against the following situation:
<p>
<p>Client 1 reads resource A.
<p>Client 2 reads resource A.
<p>Client 1 replaces the display_name property of resource A and does
a PUT to replace the resource.
<p>Client 2 replaces is different property of resource A and attempts
to perform a PUT operation.
<p>
<p>Without optimistic concurrency control, Client 2's update would
overwrite Client 1's update to the display_name property. Instead,
Client 2 receives a 409 Conflict error. To recover, Client 2 must
fetch the resource again, apply the change, and perform a PUT.
<h4>Exceptions for /policy APIs</h4>
<p>APIs whose URI begins with /policy have slightly different behavior.
For those APIs, the _revision property must <b>not</b> be set when PUT
is used to create a new resource. Once the resource is created,
however, the _revision property must be provided with PUT operations.
<h4>PATCH and _revision for /policy APIs</h4>
<p>APIs whose URI begins with /policy support the PATCH operation.
Those APIs do not require that the _revision property be provided.
A client can, however, request that the _revision property be
checked when it is performing a PATCH in the /infra path. To
do this, the client should pass the query parameter enforce_revision_check,
e.g.  PATCH /infra?enforce_revision_check=true.
</p>

<h4>PUT Operations</h4>
<p>
NSX conforms to REST and HTTP standards regarding the operation of
PUT operations. A PUT is always a full replace of a resource, and if
any properties are omitted from the payload, those properties will
be reset to default values. It is suggested that API clients retrieve
the existing resource, apply any desired changes to the copy of the resource,
and PUT the entire modified resource.
</p>

<p>
Partial patching of objects is a feature supported by NSX that allows patching
a subset of properties of any object. This behavior needs to be explicitly enabled.
When partial patching is disabled (default behavior), the entire payload of object
is expected to be provided in both PUT and PATCH operations for the /policy APIs.
</p>

<p>
In order to perform partial patching of existing objects using PATCH operation,
partial patching should be enabled using either one of the following approach:
<ol type="1">
<li><b>System-wide partial patch configuration</b><br>
Partial patch can be enabled/disabled in the system by using the Partial Patch Config api
(i.e. PATCH /policy/api/v1/system-config/nsx-partial-patch-config) with sample request payload.<br>
<div class="code_block">
{
    "enable_partial_patch": "true"
}
</div>
Default is <i>'false'</i>.<br>
<b>Note:</b> If the API request header has <i>'nsx-enable-partial-patch'</i> parameter, then
the header takes precedence over this system-wide configuration.
</li>
<li><b>Header parameter (request level configuration)</b><br>
Partial patch can also be enabled/disabled using API request header parameter. This will override
the system-wide configuration for a particular request.<br>
To enable partial patch, use <i>'nsx-enable-partial-patch=true'</i><br>
To disable partial patch, use <i>'nsx-enable-partial-patch=false'</i><br>
If this parameter is not passed in header, the system level configuration will be considered for
Partial Patch operation. This header parameter will be considered only for PATCH requests.
For other requests (e.g. PUT, POST etc.), this header parameter will be ignored.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>Some important considerations/notes on Partial Patch:</b>
<ol type="1">
<li>Array properties will be replaced entirely in partial patch.</li>
<li>If PATCH api is executed on a non-existing object, a new object will be created after performing
all applicable validations.</li>
<li>There are cases where properties of an object are inter-dependent on each other e.g. username
and password, IP address and thumbprint etc. In such cases, the partial patch request expects all
such inter-dependent fields to be provided (either all or none).</li>
<li>Partial patch is not supported for 'Infra' object.</li>
<li>Certain types like Labels, Security Policies (for the 'rules' attribute) and Services have special
handling for certain attributes in PATCH request. This behavior will not be overridden by Partial Patch.
<br>For instance, specifying rules on Security policies as a part of the PATCH invocation merges the
specified rules with the existing rules. For full replacement of rules, PUT operation needs to be
performed on the Security Policy.</li>
<li>Partial patch will not work for properties accepting polymorphic types if the specified value has a
type that is different from that of the existing value.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>API Rate Limiting</h3>

<p>
The NSX API service has three settings that control the rate
of incoming API requests:
</p>

<p>
1) A per-client rate limit, in requests per second. If a
client makes more requests than this limit in one second,
the API server will refuse to service the API request and
will return an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests Error. By default,
this limit is 100 requests per second.
</p>

<p>
2) A per-client concurrency limit. This is the maximum number
of outstanding requests that a client can have. For example,
a client can open multiple connections to NSX and submit
operations on each connection. When this limit is exceeded, the
server returns a 429 Too Many Requests error to the client. By
default, this limit is 40 concurrent requests.
</p>

<p>
3) An overall maximum number of concurrent requests. This is
the maximum number of API requests that can be in process on
the server. If the server is at this limit, additional requests
will be refused and the HTTP error 503 Service Unavailable
will be returned to the client. By default, this limit is 199
concurrent requests.
</p>

<p>
The first two limits exist to provide some level of fairness
across multiple clients of NSX, and are intended to prevent
one greedy client from preventing other clients from making
API requests.
</p>

<p>
The last limit is the server's way of protecting itself against
an unintentional (or intentional) denial of service attack.
</p>

<p>
While it is possible to configure these rate limits using the
/api/v1/node/services/http API, it is not recommended. Instead,
you should design your API client to gracefully deal with
situations where limits are exceeded.
</p>

<h4>Designing API client code to work gracefully with rate limits</h4>

<p>
One approach is to build in throttling into the client code so
that it never sends more than 100 requests in a given second and
that it never has more than 40 concurrent requests in flight.
</p>

<p>
However, there isn't any way to ensure that the overall
concurrency limits are never hit. That is because there may
be other clients calling APIs, driving up the load on the
server. API clients need to check for the HTTP error 503
Service Unavailable. In the event a 503 error is received,
the simplest strategy is to insert a delay, possibly with an
exponential backoff in the event that server load is high.
</p>

<p>
There are open-source libraries than can help you
implement this retry/backoff behavior, such as Google's
Retry helper in its Python google-api-core library. For
an example of using this library with the NSX APIs, see
