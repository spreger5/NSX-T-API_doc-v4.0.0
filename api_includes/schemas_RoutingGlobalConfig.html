The VDR MAC used by a host switch in a transport node is decided by the OVERLAY transport zone(s) which the host switch joins. If any of the OVERLAY transport zone(s) has \"nested_nsx\" property being true, the MAC in \"vdr_mac_nested\" is used; otherwise the MAC in \"vdr_mac\" is used. Thus the VDR MAC being used by a host switch in a transport node can be changed in below ways. If the host switch is not in any OVERLAY transport zone whose \"nested_nsx\" property is true but is in an OVERLAY transport zone, the first way is updating the \"vdr_mac\" property. The 2nd way is updating one of the OVERLAY tranport zones joined by the host switch to set \"nested_nsx\" property true which will make the host switch use the VDR MAC in \"vdr_mac_nested\". The third way is directly updating the transport node to add an OVERLAY transport zone whose \"nested_nsx\" property is true into the host switch which will also make the host switch use the VDR MAC in \"vdr_mac_nested\". If the host switch is in some OVERLAY transport zone(s) whose \"nested_nsx\" property is true, the first way is updating the \"vdr_mac_nested\" property. The 2nd way is updating all those OVERLAY tranport zones to set \"nested_nsx\" property false which will make the host switch use the VDR MAC in \"vdr_mac\". The third way is directly updating the transport node to remove all those OVERLAY transport zones from the host switch which will also make the host switch use the VDR MAC in \"vdr_mac\".
