Administrator can choose to categorize a security policy into the above categories or can choose to leave it empty. If empty it will have the least precedence w.r.t the above four categories. - Edge Firewall - Policy Framework for Edge Firewall provides six pre-defined categories \"Emergency\", \"SystemRules\", \"SharedPreRules\", \"LocalGatewayRules\", \"AutoServiceRules\" and \"Default\", in order of priority of rules. All categories are allowed for Gatetway Policies that belong to 'default' Domain. However, for user created domains, category is restricted to \"SharedPreRules\" or \"LocalGatewayRules\" only. Also, the users can add/modify/delete rules from only the \"SharedPreRules\" and \"LocalGatewayRules\" categories. If user doesn't specify the category then defaulted to \"Rules\". System generated category is used by NSX created rules, for example BFD rules. Autoplumbed category used by NSX verticals to autoplumb data path rules.
