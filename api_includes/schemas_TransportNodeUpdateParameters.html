The 'esx_mgmt_if_migration_dest' and 'if_id' must be used as a pair to migrate vmk interfaces; they can not be used to migrate VM NICs. NSX manager will auto-create logical ports and vif ids for the vmk interfaces when they are used to migrate vmks into logical switches. The 'vnic' and 'vnic_migration_dest' must also be used as a pair; they can be used to migrate both vmk interfaces and VM NICs. When they are used to migrate interfaces into logical switches, logical ports and vif ids must be created in advance because 'vnic_migration_dest' must contain existing vif ids.

If a VMK does not need the ping ip or a VM NIC is given inside 'vnic', the ping ip must be skipped but the comma has to stay. For example, '0.0.0.0,,10.1.1.1' indicates the vmk or VM NIC at the 2nd position does not need ping post-migration. Right after all ESX vmk interfaces are migrated, ping packets will be sent through each vmk to its given ping_ip to check if the migraton will break the network connectivity or not.
